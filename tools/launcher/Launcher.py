'''
This module's purpose is to launch the ComicVineScraper plugin from within the 
Eclipse IDE.  To do this, it must emulate the 'real' comicrack environment.

This module is a development tool; it is NOT part of the regular 
ComicVineScraper distributable and will not be run by regular users.
