   '''
   This method takes a publisher string that might be an imprint of another 
   publisher.  If it is a known imprint, the method returns a different 
   publisher string representing the parent publisher for that imprint.  If it 
   is not an imprint, this method returns the original passed in string.
   
   Both the passed in and returned strings for these methods must EXACTLY
   match their corresponding values in the ComicVine database (i.e. case, 
   punctation, etc.)
