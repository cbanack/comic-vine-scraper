This module contains is the gateway to whatever "database" this script uses to 
obtain information about comic books.   The exact nature of this database is 
intentionally vague in order to remain modular and interchangable.  In other
words, the behaviour of this "comic book database" can be understood entirely  
by knowing the contract described by the public functions in this module.  

While no promises about the underlying implementation are made, you should 
expect that this implementation accesses data from a remote source, and 
therefore may be quite slow!

   This method takes a some search terms (space separated words) and uses them
   to query the database for a comic book series objects that match those words.

   a set of them.  The set may be empty if no series matches the search, or

   You can pass in an optional callback function, which MAY be called

   the search.   If this returned value is ever true, this query should
   stop immediately and return an empty set of results.
