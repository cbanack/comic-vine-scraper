# This file contains the test data for the filename parser unit test.
# The data is formatted with three strings to a line, where the three strings
# are all either delineated by double quotes (") or all by single quotes (').
# Characters (like whitespace and commas) outside of the strings are ignored.
#
# The first string is the name of the file to parse.
# The second is the expected series name that the filename parser should find.
# The third is the expected issue number string that the parser should find.

# first some very standard ones - these are how "normal" filenames look
