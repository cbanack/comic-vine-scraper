# This file contains the test data for the filename parser unit test.
# The data is formatted with three strings to a line, where the three strings
# are all either delineated by double quotes (") or all by single quotes (').
# Characters (like whitespace and commas) outside of the strings are ignored.
#
# The first string is the name of the file to parse.
# The second is the expected series name that the filename parser should find.
# The third is the expected issue number string that the parser should find.
   
            # coryhigh: think of naming without brackets as the cuttoff??
            # maybe strip out anything in brackets, leave rest behind?
            # strip off anything after last period? unless period is too far left
            # what if whole thing is in brackets?
            
            # do a two phase process:
            #    1. strip out everything that you can
            #    2. figure out the issue number from whats left, remove it
            #    3. clean up what's left, that's the series name
            
            # how does comicrack handle that?
            # think of variant ways that "volume" can be in there.
            # think of patterns for stripping numbers?
            # negative numbers
            # test examples with both kinds of quotes in them
