class DBPictureBox(PictureBox):
   '''
   This class extends a regular .NET PictureBox so that it's image can be set
   asynchronously by giving it a SeriesRef or IssueRef object (the 
   set_image_ref method).  This ref object is then used to query the 
   comic book database to find the appropriate image (if any) to set.   

   Because accessing a database can be slow and potentially prone to errors, 
   this class contains a number of features to automatically handle
   problems that may occur:

   1) All image retrieval happens asyncronously on an external thread.   The 
   final result is only loaded into this picturebox when the image retrieval is
   finished.  If many image retrievals are requested nearly simulataneously, 
   most of them will be ignored, and only the most recent one is guaranteed to 
   actually be performed (and update the displayed image.)

   2) All image retrieval is short-term cached, so if you switch the image ref 
   back to a previous one, it will automatically use the cached image instead of 
   reloading.
