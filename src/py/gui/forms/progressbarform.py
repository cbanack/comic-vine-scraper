   A simple CVForm that displays a ProgressBar, which callers can access and
   manipulate via the 'pb' variable.   The intention is that this form will be
   briefly displayed during the time that a ProgressBar needs to be visible,
   and then it will disappear as soon as the ProgressBar isn't needed anymore.
   
   Note that if the user manually closes this Form, the __scrape_engine given in the
   __init__ method will be cancelled.
