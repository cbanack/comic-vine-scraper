"""
This module installs a GLOBAL logging system into an application.  Any 
information that is written out using the debug(), debug_exc(), or
handle_error methods will get printed to stdout.

All information that is written to stderr or stdout (by this class, or any other
mechanism) is also saved in memory, so that it can be written out to a file in 
its entirety at any time by the dump() method.

USAGE

To make the methods in this class usable, call install().  Use a 
try-finally to GUARANTEE that uninstall() will be called when your program 
completes (with or without errors).  This is VITAL in order to ensurethat
all system resources are freed and returned to their original state!

THREAD SAFETY

This module is threadsafe while running, but is not when during install() and 
uninstall(), so care should be taken not to call any other method in this 
module while either of those two methods are running.
