class Scheduler(object):
   '''
   A class that maintains its own thread, which can be used to invoke "tasks"
   (methods) in serial, last-in-ignore-everything-else order.  That means 
   that, in addition to the currently running task, if any, there can be at 
   most one other task (the most recently submitted one) queue up to run next.
   Queueing a large number of tasks in a short period of time will lead to the
   first, last, and an indeterminate number of the rest actually getting run.
   
   Do not forget to call the 'shutdown' method on any instance of this class 
   once it will no longer be used, so that its background thread can be safely
   disposed of.

      Submits the given task (a method handle) to this Scheduler, to be run on

      run almost immediately.  If the Scheduler is busy, the given task will be 
      run as soon as the Scheduler finishes its current task, UNLESS a new task 
      is added before the given task has a chance to start.  In that case, the 
      new task will take the given task's place in line, and the given task will
      never be executed.

      Shuts down this Scheduler, after it has finished any task that it may

      The 'block' boolean parameter indicates whether this method should block
